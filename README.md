# WeatherApp

WeatherApp is a simple application that displays current weather information based on user input.  
The project focuses on consuming external APIs, handling data responses, and presenting information in a clear and user-friendly way.

## Project Purpose

The goal of this project was to:
- Practice working with external REST APIs
- Understand API request / response handling
- Improve structured programming and clean code practices
- Gain experience in building small, functional applications

## Features

- Fetches real-time weather data
- Displays key weather information such as:
  - Temperature
  - Weather conditions
  - Location-based data
- Simple and clear user interface
- Error handling for invalid input or unavailable data

## Technologies Used

- Programming language: C#
- API integration (weather data provider)
- JSON data processing
- Visual Studio environment

## How It Works

1. The user provides a location.
2. The application sends a request to a weather API.
3. The response is processed and parsed.
4. Relevant weather information is displayed to the user.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained experience in:
- Working with third-party APIs
- Handling asynchronous operations
- Parsing and validating external data
- Writing readable and maintainable code

## Notes

This project was originally created as a learning exercise and later published to demonstrate my experience with API-based applications.  
The code may be extended in the future with additional features or UI improvements.
